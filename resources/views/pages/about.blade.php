                            We are committed to be the leading regional competence based education and training (CBET) provider in technical training so that we can transform the lives of our youth through provision of relevant skills for self-reliance and National Development.

                            The Government of Kenya has heavily invested in the college by providing state of art training equipment and tools so that the youth can be trained with modern equipment similar to what is available in local and international industries.

                            In order to make technical training accessible the government has reduced fees to Ksh. 56,420 per year and out of this the government pays Ksh. 30,000 for every student admitted through Kenya Universities and Colleges Central Placement Service (KUCCPS) and the needy students are also eligible to apply for HELB Loans and Bursaries to a Maximum of ksh. 40,000. Therefore, there is no reason whatsoever for any youth to remain at home under the pretext of lack of school fees.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Needy students are allowed to register and attend classes as they process HELB loans and bursaries.

                        <p>
